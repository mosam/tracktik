# Track Tik 

Question 1: 
Using the code given, create each type of electronic as classes. Every ElectronicItem must have a function called maxExtras that limits the number of extras an electronic item can have. The extras are a list of electronic items that are attached to another electronic item to complement it.

❖	The console can have a maximum of 4 extras
❖	The television has no maximum extras
❖	The microwave can't have any extras
❖	The controller can't have any extras

Create a scenario where a person would buy:

1 console, 2 televisions with different prices and 1 microwave

The console and televisions have extras; those extras are controllers. 
The console has 2 remote controllers and 2 wired controllers. 
The TV #1 has 2 remote controllers and the TV #2 has 1 remote controller.

Sort the items by price and output the total pricing.



Question 2: That person's friend saw her with her new purchase and asked her how much the console and its controllers had cost her. Give the answer.

Please return the test in a compressed PHP file or through an online Git repository (GitHub or similar).




Code:



<?php

class ElectronicItems

{

private $items = array();

public function __construct(array $items)
{

$this->items = $items;

}

/**

*	Returns the items depending on the sorting type requested

$sorted[($item->price * 100)] = $item;
